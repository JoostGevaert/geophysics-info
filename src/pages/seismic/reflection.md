# Reflection seismics

Reflection seismics is a geophysical technique that uses seismic waves to image the subsurface of the Earth.

In reflection seismics, a series of geophones are placed on the ground surface and a seismic energy source, such as a small explosion or a heavy weight dropped on the ground, is used to create a seismic wave that travels through the subsurface. The seismic wave reflects back to the surface when it encounters a boundary between materials with different acoustic properties.

Geophysicists analyze the reflected waves to create a 2D or 3D image of the subsurface. By measuring the time it takes for the waves to reflect back to the surface and the amplitude of the reflected waves, geophysicists can determine the depth, thickness, and properties of different subsurface layers, including geological formations, sediment layers, and water-bearing formations.

reflection seismics is widely used in the oil and gas industry for exploring and mapping underground oil and gas reservoirs. It is also used in geotechnical engineering for assessing the stability of rock slopes and in environmental studies for mapping subsurface geological structures and identifying potential environmental hazards, such as buried toxic waste.
