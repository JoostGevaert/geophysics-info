# Ground penetrating radar (GPR)

Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a geophysical technique that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface of the Earth. It is a non-invasive method that allows geophysicists to study the structure and composition of the subsurface without physically disturbing it.

In GPR, a transmitter sends out short pulses of high-frequency electromagnetic radiation (radio waves) into the ground. These waves travel through the subsurface and bounce back to the surface when they encounter a change in the electrical conductivity or permittivity of the subsurface materials. The receiver then detects the reflected waves and measures the strength and time delay of the signal.

The GPR system uses this information to create a two-dimensional image of the subsurface. By analyzing the reflected signals, geophysicists can determine the depth, thickness, and geometry of underground features such as buried objects, geological structures, and water tables.

GPR is commonly used in a variety of applications, including archaeology, engineering, and environmental studies. For example, archaeologists may use GPR to map buried artifacts or structures at archaeological sites, while engineers may use GPR to locate underground utilities or assess the condition of roads and bridges. Environmental scientists may use GPR to locate subsurface water resources, study soil structure, or detect pollution.
