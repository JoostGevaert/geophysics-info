# Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT)

Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) is a geophysical technique that measures the electrical resistivity of subsurface materials to create a 3D image of the subsurface.

In ERT, a set of electrodes are placed on the surface of the ground, forming a grid or a line, and a small electrical current is sent through one pair of electrodes while the voltage is measured at another pair of electrodes. The process is then repeated with different electrode pairs in order to gather data at various points across the survey area.

The electrical current is affected by the electrical properties of the subsurface materials, which vary depending on the composition and water content of the materials. Some materials, like rocks, are highly resistant to electrical currents, while others, like water, are highly conductive. By measuring the electrical resistivity at different points across the survey area, geophysicists can create a 2D or 3D image of the subsurface materials.

The resulting image can be used to identify geological features such as rock layers, faults, and fractures, as well as to locate water-bearing formations, such as aquifers.

ERT is a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, including environmental studies, geotechnical engineering, and mineral exploration. It is non-invasive and relatively low-cost compared to other subsurface imaging methods, making it a popular choice for many geophysical surveys.
