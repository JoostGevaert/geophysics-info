# Electromagnetic geophysical methods

Electromagnetic geophysical methods are a subset of geophysics that use the principles of electromagnetism to study the physical properties of the Earth.

When an electrical current flows through a conductor, it creates a magnetic field around the conductor. Similarly, a changing magnetic field can induce an electrical current in a conductor. Electromagnetic geophysical methods take advantage of these principles to study the Earth.
