# Seismic Refraction Tomography (SRT)

Seismic Refraction Tomography (SRT) is a geophysical technique that uses seismic waves to image the subsurface of the Earth.

In SRT, a series of geophones are placed in a line or a grid on the ground surface, and a seismic energy source, such as a sledgehammer or explosive charge, is used to create a seismic wave that travels through the subsurface. The geophones record the arrival times and amplitudes of the seismic waves as they travel through different layers of the Earth.

The speed of seismic waves depends on the properties of the materials through which they travel. For example, seismic waves travel faster through denser materials like rock, and slower through less dense materials like soil or sediment. By analyzing the arrival times and amplitudes of the seismic waves, geophysicists can determine the depth, thickness, and properties of different layers of the subsurface.

SRT is commonly used in a variety of applications, including geotechnical engineering, mineral exploration, and groundwater studies. For example, engineers may use SRT to determine the depth and thickness of bedrock or other subsurface layers in order to design building foundations or other infrastructure. Mineral exploration companies may use SRT to locate ore bodies or other mineral deposits. Hydrologists may use SRT to locate water-bearing formations or map subsurface water flow.
